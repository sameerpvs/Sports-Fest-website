 <p id="h4">Sports Bout which simply means a Sports Competition was an initiative by the Department Of Physical Education at Anurag Group Of Institution in the year 2012. It was Basically a thought of encouraging a healthy competition in sports among the students pursuing Engineering and Pharmacy in various  colleges. Later it turned out to be a great opportunity for many talented players to expose their skills and build up a healthy sports community. We have been successful since the year 2012 with complete encouragement and support from the Management . Every year we aim at introducing new sports and games for  competition and to award the best out of best . With a lot of planning to go ahead,our team is proving to be more efficient and successful year by year. </p>
